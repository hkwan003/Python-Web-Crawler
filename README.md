# Python-Web-Crawler

This is a web crawler written in python that takes in input from the URL of the site I provide. It will scrape the site for links and place them into a stack. It will then compare that link so an existing stack with links already populate to see it has been visited already. This is highly inefficient but will work for my purposes. Simple Python source code to implement, will combine with a website later on. Will have personal website up in a bit.
